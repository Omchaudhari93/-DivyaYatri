  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    DivyaYatri is dedicated to making spiritual journeys across Maharashtra more accessible, informed, and peaceful. Whether you're traveling to attend the sacred Kumbh Mela or to explore ancient temples, we aim to provide clear, respectful, and useful guidance to all devotees.
  </p>

  <h2>Why We Started</h2>
  <p>
    Every year, lakhs of devotees visit temples and religious places. Yet, many face difficulties due to lack of information, language issues, or senior citizen accessibility. DivyaYatri was born out of a desire to bridge that gap ‚Äî combining tradition with technology.
  </p>

  <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
  <p>
    We are a small team of developers, designers, and spiritual seekers who believe in the power of seva (selfless service). This project is made with love, respect, and the intent to serve our community.
  </p>

  <h2>What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
  <p>
    We're planning to add yatra planning tools, live darshan updates, senior support features, and much more. If you'd like to contribute or give feedback, please contact us!
